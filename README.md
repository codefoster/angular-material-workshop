Above is a snapshot of the AMMC Jumpstart application with a **Master-Detail** layout; showing a list of users
(left) and a user detail view (right).


This Jumpstart application demonstrates how:

* [Flex-Layout](http://github.com/angular/flex-layout) directives (`fxLayout`, `fxFlex`, `fxLayoutGap`) can create advanced layouts.
* [Angular Material](http://github.com/angular/material2) components can be used to create a good-looking production-ready app.
* [Angular Material CDK](https://material.angular.io/guide/getting-started) CDK services and classes that can be used to create a good-looking production-ready app.
